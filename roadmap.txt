Long term goals

Add an editing mode where one could create problems.
Maybe extend this to allowing for games rather than just problems?
Maybe allow for network play?
Maybe convert to a web app?

Tasks:
 - Move files from android to python.
 - First decide on object structure
 - Build basic Go objects.
 - Then build parser (more fun than ui even if arguably should be after)
 - Build UI for board
 - Build UI for solving problems
 - Build UI for problem selection
