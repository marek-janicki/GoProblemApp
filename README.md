# GoProblemApp
Description:
This is an app designed around solving Go Problems.

History:
This app originated a few years ago as a collaboration a few years ago
between myself and a friend while we were theory grad students at the
university of Toronto. We decided on Andriod because it was exciting
at the time. We had two main bouts of development, and originally I
took more of the backendy/parsing bits, and my friend worked on the UI.
That being said, I appear to no longer have his code and only have the
basic UI I built to test my code. However, I can no longer recall the
finer distinctions of who did what, so I can't confidently say to whom
any of the legacy code belongs.

I've decided to resurrect and move this code to python because it's been
a while since I've done anything beyond a script in python. 

Where files live:  
Old android source files live in /legacy  
One or two go problem files live in /problems  
Current python code lives in /src  
roadmap.txt has the larger plan for the app. Not sure if it's large
or heavy enough to merit the use of a heavier system. For now will
see how the text file goes.

How to Run:
Not at that point yet with the new code.

I suppose if you're so inclined you could find an emulator for Android
Froyo(!) and used the source files to build an app that will run on that.
But really not worth your time.
